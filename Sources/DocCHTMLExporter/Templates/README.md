<h2>zzdoc Templates</h2>

This folder contains the default Mustache templates used,
plus the `Site.css` containing the default CSS.

It is used as a fallback if the `Templates` (resource) directory in the package root cannot 
be reached, or not `-t/--templates` option was specified.
When PR'ing changes, please do so in the resource directory.
